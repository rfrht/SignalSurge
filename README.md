# SignalSurge

This is an open source (check licensing [here](https://github.com/rfrht/SignalSurge/blob/main/LICENSE)) Bandpass filter for VHF and UHF bands, with a selectable LNA and a sequencer. Projected using Eagle CAD 9.

Check the schematic [here](https://github.com/rfrht/SignalSurge/blob/main/SS.pdf) (you will need to download it, as the GitHub renderer isn't super happy with the Eagle-generated PDF file)

## Maturity level
Absolutely incomplete and preliminary.
