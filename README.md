# SignalSurge

This is an open source (check licensing [here](https://github.com/rfrht/SignalSurge/blob/main/LICENSE)) Bandpass filter for VHF and UHF bands, with a selectable LNA and a sequencer. Projected using Eagle CAD 9.

Schematic:

## BPF performance
Here's the calculated theoretical filter performance, for VHF and UHF bands:

![UHF BPF performance](https://github.com/rfrht/SignalSurge/blob/main/others/bpf-uhf.png)

Let's see how that work out in the real world.

## Maturity level
* Reached the preliminary "minimally lovable project".
* I think that with regards to the base components and schematic, this is pretty much it.

### To Do
* Build the board layout

## CHANGELOG
* Rev. A: Initial release
